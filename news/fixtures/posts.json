The news was accompanied by a short new CG trailer, titled Father and Son, which shows off Kratos and Atreus fighting off multiple threats – including an absolutely enormous wolf. Incidentally that wolf might well be Fenrir who in Norse mythology is the son of Loki. If you've played the last game in the series that's a complicated idea./r/n</p><p>Sony also announced that pre-orders will open on July 15, and showed off four separate editions of the game – including one with a full replica of Thor's Mjolnir. After being announced for a 2021 release, the return of Kratos and Atreus was eventually delayed into 2022 (apparently because of surgery undergone by lead voice actor Christopher Judge).Previous reports, including IGN's own sources, said the game was originally set to launch in September, but was pushed back to November./r/n</p><p>God of War: Ragnarok picks up from the Norse reboot for the classic action series, and a gameplay trailer showed us a familiar mix of fantasy combat, and family bickering. The game will finally introduce Thor, and will seemingly introduce some exciting changes to the action systems. In other God of War news, Sony is reportedly developing a God of War series for Amazon, to go along with its other series productions, like the Horizon series on Netflix and The Last of Us for HBO./r/n</p>",
