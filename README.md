## Database
- __News application database schema__

When creating the database structure schema for this project, I utilized the [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) website. This online tool allowed me to visually design and document the database schema, making it easier to plan and implement the database for the news application.

## Deployment

**Create the Heroku app:**

- Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name.
- Click on the Settings tab and reveal the config vars.
- Add a key of DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and a value of 1 and click Add.
- This step prevents Heroku from uploading static files, such as CSS and JS, during the build.
---
**Update your code for deployment:**

- Install a production-ready webserver for Heroku using the command <mark>pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1</mark>
- Add gunicorn==20.1.0 to the requirements.txt file with: <mark>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</mark>
- Create a file named Procfile at the root directory of the project (same directory as requirements.txt).
- In the Procfile, declare this is a web process followed by the command to execute your Django project and start the server.
  <mark>web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi</mark> This assumes your project is named my_project.
- Open the my_project/settings.py file and replace DEBUG=True with DEBUG=False. and append the '.herokuapp.com' hostname to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list.
- Git add, commit and push the code to your GitHub repo.
---
**Connect Heroku to PostgreSQL database:**
- Navigate to heroku dashbord and return to settings.
- Click on <mark>Reveal Config Vars</mark> and add <mark>DATABASE_URL</mark>.
- Note! if ElephantSQL is used as a PostgreSQL provider. 
- Navigate to https://www.elephantsql.com/, log in and create a database instance.
- Open your created instance and go to the details tag.
- copy the provided PostgreSQL <mark>URL</mark>.
- Assign it as a value to DATABASE_URL in the Heroku dashboard.
- Now your PostgreSQL cloud database is connected to your deployed app.
---
**Deploy to Heroku:**
- Add the environment variable <mark>SECRET KEY</mark> to the Heroku app's config vars in the settings for security reasons.
- Now, let's return to the Heroku dashboard, and in your app, click on the Deploy tab.
- In the Deployment method section enable GitHub integration by clicking on Connect to GitHub.
- Search for your GitHub repo and connect it to the Heroku app.
- Scroll down and Manually deploy the main branch of this GitHub repo.
- In your new appâ€™s resources tab, ensure you are using an eco dyno and delete any Postgres database Add-on.
- Click on <mark>Open app</mark> to open the rendered webpage.
---
### Fork the Repository:
By forking the GitHub Repository, you can create a copy of the original repository without affecting the original. To implement that follow these steps below:

- Log into GitHub account or create one if you don't have one.
- Locate the Repository. Note! the repository is at https://github.com/programmer-1991/gamers-digest.
- At the top right of the repository page, click "Fork" to create a copy in your own GitHub repository.

**Clone the Repository:**
When you create a repository on GitHub.com, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Creating a clone allows you to have a local copy of the project. Follow these steps:

- Navigate to https://github.com/programmer-1991/gamers-digest.
- Click the green "Code" button at the top right.
- Select the "Clone by HTTPS" option and copy the web URL to the clipboard.
- Open your code editor or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
- Run `git clone` followed by the copied URL.
- Press enter, and Git will clone the repository to your local machine.
