## Database

When creating the database structure schema for this project, I utilized the [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) website. This online tool allowed me to visually design and document the database schema, making it easier to plan and implement the database for the news application.

## Deployment

**Create the Heroku app:**

- Navigate to your Heroku dashboard and create a new app with a unique name.
- Click on the Settings tab and reveal the config vars. 
- Add a key of DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and a value of 1 and click Add. 
- This step prevents Heroku from uploading static files, such as CSS and JS, during the build.
---
**Update your code for deployment:**

- Install a production-ready webserver for Heroku using the command <mark>pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1</mark>
- Add gunicorn==20.1.0 to the requirements.txt file with: <mark>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt</mark>
- Create a file named Procfile at the root directory of the project (same directory as requirements.txt).
- In the Procfile, declare this is a web process followed by the command to execute your Django project and start the server.
  <mark>web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi</mark> This assumes your project is named my_project.
- Open the my_project/settings.py file and replace DEBUG=True with DEBUG=False. and append the '.herokuapp.com' hostname to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list.
- Git add, commit and push the code to your GitHub repo.
---
**Connect Heroku to PostgreSQL database:**
- Navigate to heroku dashbord and return to settings.
- Click on <mark>Reveal Config Vars</mark> and add <mark>DATABASE_URL</mark>.
- Note! if ElephantSQL is used as a PostgreSQL provider. 
- Navigate to https://www.elephantsql.com/, log in and create a database instance.
- Open your created instance and go to the details tag.
- copy the provided PostgreSQL <mark>URL</mark>.
- Assign it as a value to DATABASE_URL in the Heroku dashboard.
- Now your PostgreSQL cloud database is connected to your deployed app.
---
**Deploy to Heroku:**
- Now, let's return to the Heroku dashboard, and in your app, click on the Deploy tab. 
- In the Deployment method section enable GitHub integration by clicking on Connect to GitHub.
- Search for your GitHub repo and connect it to the Heroku app.
